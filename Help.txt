Undo/Redo
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23608166/undo-method-for-a-paint-program
	Though it may not be efficient to store all intermediate images. Generally the idea is to generate some commands each time you alter
	the painting area. Say you have draw() and erase(). You will then store these commands as they are invoked. Then, when undo is needed,
	take the last command and "reverse" it. Once you've done undo, the implementation of redo should become apparent.
